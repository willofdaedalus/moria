## what's this?
moria is just a collection of exercises I'm working through on a daily basis 
(I hope) to solidify my understanding of memory and low level concepts. I recently
joined a company that works in low level development which I've always found
fascinating and so I had this list of exercises generated where I can do them
for the next few months. As if I'm not under more stress already :melting_face:
You can view these exercises in the `moria.csv` file and follow along if you want!  

Here's the compile flags I use to punish myself further :)  
```sh
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu99
```

## what's up with this name??
I've been reading Lord of the Rings and finished The Fellowship of the Ring some
days ago and the whole sequence where Gandalf and Company have to go through the
city of Moria and fight a fricking balrog has stuck on my mind for some time. I
only chose this name because it always reminds me its famous mines of mithril.
Anyway I'm getting side-tracked :)
